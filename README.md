## About
### A custom Synapse X user interface with the following features:
- Everything from the official UI

- Renamable tabs and scripts

- Lots of color options
- More context menu options
- Custom message/prompt window

#### Any virus results are false positives, it's because of sxlib.dll and SLInjector.dll (which is a part of Synapse X)

## Known bugs
- If the application crashes while loading i sadly can't do anything about it as it's because sxlib is unstable
- Sometimes you will repeatedly get an error message saying that you need to attach Synapse X before executing a script. Right now I'm not sure if it's a sxlib problem or if it's a problem with my ui
- Auto attach is not currently working
